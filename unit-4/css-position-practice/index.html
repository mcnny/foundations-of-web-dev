        <h1>Static</h1>
        static is the default value. An element is positioned static;
        is not positioned in any special way.

    <div class="relative1">
        <h1>Relative</h1>
        Relative behaves the same as static UNLESS you add some extra
        properties. Such as <i>top, right, bottom, left</i>

        <b>A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which
            means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page
            is scrolled. As with a relative, the top, right, bottom, and
            left properties are used.
        </b>

        <h1>fixed</h1>

        A <b>fixed</b> element is positioned relative to the viewport, 
        which means it always stays in the same place EVEN if the page 
        is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and 
        left properties are used.
    </div>

    <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the
        nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to 
        the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="relative">This div element is position; relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;
        </div>
    </div>
